Export All Producteev Tasks to CSV
==================================

Peace out y'all!
--------------------------

Producteev, it's been real. 3 years now.

Fueled purely by a desire to export my tasks from Producteev, I've been forced to build my own API consumer in lieu of a proper Export feature.  Naturally the code is yours free if you want it:

This project writes a CSV file and displays results in Bootstrap fluid 12-column grid.

Thanks for the good times Producteev, and best of luck in all your ventures.
